  <h1>Important Concepts</h1>

  <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
  <p>
   <b>How the Web Works</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The web is millions of computers that communicate with
    each other. When a person goes to a web page like
    www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em>
    to a <em>server</em>. A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.The server finds the appropriate
    HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where
    a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it
    on the user's screen.

    does a good job of explaining more.
  </p>
  <p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
    Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
  </p>
  <p
    </p><b>HTML</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML
    documents form the majority of the content on the web.
    HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes
    "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it
    looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a>
    gives a good overview.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  </p>
    HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
    writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element
    by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
    explains the distinction well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
    literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small
    mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
    Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
    content inside of them.
  </p>
  <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
    Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
    content inside of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
    elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
    draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had
    multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
    <br>
    In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
    nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
    boxes, and so on...
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
    of changing indentations going up and down the left side
    of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
    deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Text Editors (for programming)</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like
    <i>Sublime Text</i>). These editors make the programmer's
    life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
    generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
